title: Base Scaffold
---

All our apps are built on top of a base scaffold.

```
<name>
    - frontend
        - pages/...
        - api/...
        - package.json
    - supabase
        - migration files
```


This ensures that all our apps are built on top of a consistent structure, and we can easily add new features to the base scaffold.
The following files are pre-generated and edited by AI and the user on the go. We will be verifying that the code generated is always consistent with the base scaffold.

1. package.json
 - remix 
2. supabase auth
 - google auth
 - github auth
3. secret `API_KEYS` management
